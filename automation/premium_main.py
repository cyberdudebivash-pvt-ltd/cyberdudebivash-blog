    # provider stack so a cooldown survives new Actions processes, and the
    # evidence compiler becomes the final structural authority after every
    # legacy prompt/HTML recovery layer has been installed. Neither layer
    # replaces ReportX, report_integrity, artifact hashing or Blogger fetch-back.
