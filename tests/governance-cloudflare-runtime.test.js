/**
 * SENTINEL APEX — Cloudflare Runtime Dependency Guard (Phase 45-48)
 *
 * Static-source regression guard for the Cloudflare-Only Runtime tranches
 * (Alert Orchestration v1 / PR #137, Cloudflare-Only Alert Runtime v1 /
 * PR #138, Cloudflare-Only Runtime Completion v2). Precise, not naive: this
 * does NOT assert "no file in this codebase may use Redis" -- auth,
 * billing, and the 35-file ReportX/Intelligence Factory surface are
 * DELIBERATELY still Redis-backed (see
 * docs/audits/SENTINEL-APEX-AUTH-BILLING-DEFERRAL-AUDIT-V2.md and
 * SENTINEL-APEX-REPORTX-INTEL-FACTORY-RUNTIME-AUDIT-V2.md) and asserting
 * otherwise would be both wrong today and an obstacle to those subsystems'
 * own future migrations. This guard only watches the specific files this
 * platform has already, deliberately, migrated to D1 -- catching an
 * accidental re-introduction of a Redis dependency (e.g. a bad merge, a
 * copy-pasted snippet from an old version) in exactly those files.
 *
 * Reads source text directly rather than require()-ing modules: these are
 * static-shape assertions ("does this file's source still mention
 * redis.get"), not behavioral tests -- the real behavioral coverage for
 * every file named here already exists in its own __tests__ suite.
